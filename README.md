 - Then start **npm** with `npm start`


----------

 - To start the simulator if you are on **Mac**, click the letter `I` as per instructions, and it should start right up.
 - To start the simulator on an **Android** device, you need a simulator up and running. **Genymotion** is probably the best. Once your simulator is up and running, press `A` and the simulator should start on the android device.

----------

- Once the app has started up, click 'Allow' push notifications, as that feature won't work if it doesn't have permissison.

**Note!!! <br>** Very little testing has been done on the Android simulator as it has been causing me alot of trouble and wouldn't stop throwing nonsense error early on. <br>Also, errors have been occurring and styling is off on Iphone X(10)
